# Fibonacci-Sequence

Fibonacci was an italian mathematician who came up with the Fibonacci sequence:
0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144...
Where every number is the sum of the two previous ones.
e.g. 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5 comes from:
0 + 1 = 1
1 + 1 = 2
1 + 2 = 3
2 + 3 = 5
etc
The intention is to create a function where you can call it by writing the code:
fibonacciGenerator (n), where n is the number of items in the sequence.
So I should be able to call:
fibonacciGenerator(3) and get [0, 1, 1] as the output.

Please see the fibonacci.js file for the code.
